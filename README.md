# NASA Astronaut Health Monitoring Project

## Overview
This project represents a groundbreaking collaboration with NASA, focusing on monitoring the health of astronauts during their missions aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Unlike typical academic studies, this project confronts real-world challenges by utilizing advanced bio-monitoring technology and deep learning techniques to forecast astronauts' health conditions, particularly focusing on their cardio-respiratory responses.

## Project Description
We developed a custom deep learning model that combines 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms. This model was initially trained on historical data from previous NASA missions. Its primary application is to predict astronauts' ability to stand for three minutes on the day of landing, after a six-month space mission. Accurate predictions enable the personalization and optimization of recovery programs post-flight, leading to significant cost savings and enhanced astronaut care.

## Data Privacy and Public Dataset
Due to privacy concerns with the actual mission data, the code in this repository is trained on the MIT ECG datasets. These datasets are widely recognized for their complexity and are considered comprehensive in the field of ECG classification, providing a robust framework for developing and testing our model.
